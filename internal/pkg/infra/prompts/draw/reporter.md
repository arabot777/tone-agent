|----------------|-------------|------|------|
| Feature 1      | Description | Pros | Cons |
| Feature 2      | Description | Pros | Cons |
```

# Notes

- If uncertain about any information, acknowledge the uncertainty.
- Only include verifiable facts from the provided source material.

- For each citation, use the format: `- [Source Title](URL)`
- Include an empty line between each citation for better readability.
- Include images using `![Image Description](image_url)`. The images should be in the middle of the report, not at the end or separate section.
- The included images should **only** be from the information gathered **from the previous steps**. **Never** include images that are not from the previous steps
- Directly output the Markdown raw content without "```markdown" or "```".
- Always use the language specified by the locale = **{{ locale }}**.
